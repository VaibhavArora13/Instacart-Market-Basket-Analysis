    "## Motivation\n",
    "I was looking to run association analysis in Python using the apriori algorithm to derive rules of the form {A} -> {B}. However, I quickly discovered that it's not part of the standard Python machine learning libraries. Although there are some implementations that exist, I could not find one capable of handling large datasets. \"Large\" in my case was an orders dataset with 32 million records, containing 3.2 million unique orders and about 50K unique items (file size just over 1 GB). So, I decided to write my own implementation, leveraging the apriori algorithm to generate simple {A} -> {B} association rules. Since I only care about understanding relationships between any given pair of items, using apriori to get to item sets of size 2 is sufficient. I went through various iterations, splitting the data into multiple subsets just so I could get functions like crosstab and combinations to run on my machine with 8 GB of memory. :) But even with this approach, I could only process about 1800 items before my kernel would crash... And that's when I learned about the wonderful world of Python generators.\n",

    "## Python Generators\n",
    "In a nutshell, a generator is a special type of function that returns an iterable sequence of items. However, unlike regular functions which return all the values at once (eg: returning all the elements of a list), a generator yields one value at a time. To get the next value in the set, we must ask for it - either by explicitly calling the generator's built-in \"next\" method, or implicitly via a for loop. This is a great property of generators because it means that we don't have to store all of the values in memory at once. We can load and process one value at a time, discard when finished and move on to process the next value. This feature makes generators perfect for creating item pairs and counting their frequency of co-occurence. Here's a concrete example of what we're trying to accomplish:\n",

The numerator, on the other hand, represents how often apple and egg actually appear together in the same order. In this example, that is 60% of the time.

    "From the output above, we see that the top associations are not surprising, with one flavor of an item being purchased with another flavor from the same item family (eg: Strawberry Chia Cottage Cheese with Blueberry Acai Cottage Cheese, Chicken Cat Food with Turkey Cat Food, etc). As mentioned, one common application of association rules mining is in the domain of recommender systems. Once item pairs have been identified as having positive relationship, recommendations can be made to customers in order to increase sales. And hopefully, along the way, also introduce customers to items they never would have tried before or even imagined existed!"
